          <h3>Below is a list of some of my favorite things about Sweden:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not too many sunny days</li>
                <i>(I have a pupil dilation issue which makes it difficult to see in bright sun)</i>
                <li>It hardly ever gets too hot outside, except for <s>August</s> July and August.</li>
                <li>It's easy to pay your bill at almost any restaurant or grocery store - <b>just blip!</b> :)</li>
                <li> <a href="https://nordicperspective.com/culture/what-swedish-people-are-really-like">
                    People tend to keep to themselves in public (not make small talk)</a> </li>
                <li>The pastries sold in caf√©s are <strong>so</strong> very good!</li>
