          <h3>Below is a list of some of my favorite things about Sweden:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not too many sunny days</li>
                <i>I have a pupil dilation issue which makes it difficult to see in bright sun.</i>
                <li>It hardly ever gets too hot outside, except for <s> August </s>  
                    July and August.</li>
                <li>It's easy to pay your bill at any restaurant or grocery store - <b>just blip! :)</b></li>
                <li></li>

            </ul>
